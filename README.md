• Title: The Keeper's Magical Heap Quest
• Theme: Organize a collection of magical artifacts by their power levels using heaps for quick access and retrieval!
• Tasks:
1. Insert artifacts with their power levels into a Max-Heap and display the heap after each addition.
2. Remove the most powerful artifact from the heap and re-heapify.
3. Transform a random collection of artifact power levels into a properly structured Max-Heap.
• Goal: To demonstrate the use of heap data structures (Max-Heap or Min-Heap) for efficient organization and retrieval of data, represented as magical artifacts with power levels. It teaches key operations like inserting elements, removing the root (most or least powerful artifact), and converting an unsorted array into a valid heap, highlighting how heaps enable quick access and priority-based processing in practical scenarios.
